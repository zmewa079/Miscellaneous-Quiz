# Miscellaneous-Quiz
## Objective 
+ Create a quiz game that contain four random categories to choose from.

## Getting Started:

## Motivation:
#### I've always enjoyed playing trivia games. I want to create a quiz where instead of having one topic to choose from, there will be several. More fun topics definetily equate to more fun and that was the goal.
